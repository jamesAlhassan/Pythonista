# Silent auctions are a type of charity auction and nonprofit fundraising event. During silent auctions, organizations raise money by taking bids on auction items and selling each to the highest bidder. Bidding is either conducted by using paper bid sheets or mobile bidding software.

# This Program lets bidders bid secretly. It then selects the bidder with the highest bid and declares him/her as winner
